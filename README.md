## Introduction
This project integrates IoT and Machine Learning (ML) to develop a Smart Greenhouse Decision Support System. It optimizes tomato cultivation by automating irrigation, temperature control, and disease detection. The system improves crop yield and reduces resource wastage by leveraging real-time environmental data.

---

## Project Objectives
1. Develop an IoT device to monitor real-time environmental conditions (e.g., temperature, humidity, soil moisture, light).
2. Train ML models to predict optimal watering schedules and amounts.
3. Automate greenhouse components like irrigation systems, cooling fans, and heaters.
4. Provide a user-friendly web application for monitoring and manual control.
5. Enhance water use efficiency and crop yield for sustainable tomato cultivation.
